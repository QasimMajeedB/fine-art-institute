Introduction: –

Our client is an institute by the name “Institute of Fine Arts”, which has been started by the two well-trained professionals who are one of the standard people in the field of animation and fine arts. The procedures that they follow are they first conduct classes on paintings, animation, etc.

During the course schedules, they conduct competitions among the students, for which all the students must participate in these competitions and have to submit their paintings with in the stipulated time. They ask the students to come up with some paintings, which they need to create with their own creativity along with some sentences like poems, quotations, stories, etc. that are to be described along with their paintings. The students based on their creativity, design on their respective computers and then submit their designs (paintings) in the form of a jpeg file, with in the stipulated time to the college.

Once the due date is crossed, the submissions of the designs as created by the students will not be accepted. These students will be disqualified in the competitions. And after the due date the college will not evaluate the designs received from the students based on the creativity and the quotations or poems, and then they will select the best designs and distribute the awards to the students with the best designs.

They at times in order to boost up the competitive spirit in the students, they will display the best paintings done by the students in the exhibitions, at which the paintings will be sold at the price decided by the painter (Student). The money received for the painting which is sold out in the exhibition is handed over to the student itself.
